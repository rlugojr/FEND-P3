# FEND-P05

## Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

* * *

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn Javascript in more depth by learning about intermediate topics such as scopes, "this", prototype chains and Image\\Video manipulation using Canvas.  Applying these concepts through the development of a video game, not only helped to make very complex topics easy to understand but also made the entire process enjoyable and rewarding.

_Note: This repository contains my version of the solution to complete Udacity's Front End Web Developer's Project #05._
