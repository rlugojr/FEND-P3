# FEND-P05

## Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

* * *

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn Javascript in more depth by applying intermediate concepts such as scopes, clojures, "this", OOP with prototype chains and Image+Video manipulation using Canvas.  Applying these concepts through the development of a video game, not only helped to make very complex topics easy to understand but also made the entire process enjoyable and rewarding.

_Note: This repository contains my version of the solution to complete Udacity's Front End Web Developer's Project #05.

### Game Notes:

Due to CORS limitation on browser, running game locally is best in FireFox.  If you setup a web server, Chrome should work just as well.

### License

The original source code was created using VanillaJS and MANY long nights and weekends.   This was a labor of love, not because of the subject, but because I found a true love for developing games.  I would have taken a few more months to keep adding on if I didn't worry about time limitations.  Please refer to the repositories for the attributed software for any applicable license information or technical issues with their respective products.

My solution to the assignment is free for use by anyone, especially other Udacity FEND students who could benefit from the examples provided.
